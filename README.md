Have you ever ran into issues where, while trying to copy updated files to your IIS-hosted websites, some of the files were locked? This TFS task will allow you to stop the app pool first, copy your files, and then start the app pool. Pretty simple.

This is a fork of mdaslamansari/ApplicationPoolStartStop with a few improvements (IMO).
